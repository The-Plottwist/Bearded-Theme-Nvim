# Bearded Theme For Neovim

Not a complete colorscheme (I don't have plans to make it complete either) therefore adding to the archive.

These are the theme files that are converted via [djanho](https://github.com/viniciusmuller/djanho) to neovim from [Bearded Theme](https://github.com/BeardedBear/bearded-theme).

  
To use, move ```colors``` directory to your neovim config:
```bash
mv colors PATH_TO_CONFIG/.nvim/
```

Themes will be accessible.

# Condition
Causes faulty highlights with some plugins.
